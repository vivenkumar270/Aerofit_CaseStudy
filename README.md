# Aerofit_CaseStudy

This repository contains code and analysis related to Aerofit treadmill customer data. The project aims to understand customer demographics, fitness goals, and purchase behavior for the three Aerofit treadmill models: KP281, KP481, and KP781.

Data:

The data used for this analysis is simulated and does not represent real customer information.

Files:

    aerofit_analysis.py (or similar): Python script containing the core analysis code. This script might include functions for:
        Data loading and cleaning
        Descriptive statistics by product category
        Data visualization (charts, tables)
        (Optional) More advanced analytics (e.g., segmentation, modeling)
    data (or similar folder): This folder may contain the data files used in the analysis (CSV format is common).

How to Run:

    Ensure you have Python and required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, etc.) installed. Refer to their respective documentation for installation instructions.
    Open aerofit_analysis.py in your preferred Python IDE or code editor.
    Update file paths if your data is located in a different directory.
    Run the script. This will execute the analysis and generate visualizations (likely saved as image files).

Further Exploration:

    This project provides a starting point for customer analytics. You can extend it by:
        Including more advanced segmentation techniques.
        Building predictive models to forecast future sales or customer behavior.
        Performing hypothesis testing to validate relationships between variables.
